Hi, this is the code we used to generate our poster for a creative coding workshop.

# To make your own

1. Make the base image and save it inside the `Main` folder as `base.png`. The default resolution is `842x1192px.`
2. Run the `Main\Main.pde` with [processing 3](https://processing.org/download/).
3. It will generate a lot of images with that compose the animation frames. Press `ESC` when you think it is enough.
4. Move these images from `Main` to `Fibo` folder.
5. Configure the `Fibo\Fibo.pde` by changing the `total`variable to the amount of images you generated in step 3.
6. Run `Fibo\Fibo.pde`, it will generate new images inside the `Fibo` folder and will close automatically when it is done.
7. Now you can move to photoshop and make your own gif.

Cheers ;)
